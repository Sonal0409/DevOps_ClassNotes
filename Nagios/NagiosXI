NAGIOS XI

Create a virtual machine with 4GB ram on GCP

Install docker on it

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt-get update ; clear
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce
sudo service docker start

RUN the below image to create a container for nagiosxi

docker run -d -p 80:80 --name nagiosxi lerndevops/nagios:xi5.5.6

It is a heavy image, it will take time to create the container

take externalip:80 to access nagiosxi frontend
> click on access nagiosxi
> set the timezone to new delhi
> press next
> USername=> nagiosadmin
> password => nagiosadmin
> give email address

> click finish install

> Click on login to Nagios XI
> give username : nagiosadmin
  password as nagiosadmin

> agree on agreement and click on submit

On host summary you will see 1 host, that it is monitoring itself

Setup complete.

Scenario 1: monitor a lInux host
***************************

for nagios server to monitor any other host machine, we have to first make chnages on the host machine
we have to install NRPE plugin on the linux slave/host machine

For that :

go to configure --> configure wizards --> select linux server

provide external ip of slave VM

select os as ubuntu

press next

Click on Agent installation instructions

Execute following steps from the document

Installing The Agent
Download the Linux NRPE agent to the /tmp directory on the Linux server you wish to monitor.
cd /tmp
wget https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagiosxi/agents/linux-nrpe-agent.tar.gz
Unpack the installation archive you just downloaded:
tar xzf linux-nrpe-agent.tar.gz
Enter the newly created agent subdirectory:
cd linux-nrpe-agent

Run the wrapper script as root (if using Ubuntu you'll need to either run sudo -i to run as root or run the
command with sudo in front):
./fullinstall

It will take some time to update


Go back to nagios xi

configure wixard--> linux server--> give details--press next --

explain monitoring settings


ALLOW FROM on VM2
give as : 0.0.0.0/0   ==> give all addresses

Agent/slave set up is done

Go to nagios xi front end and click on finish

go to HOME

2 host will be avialble now

click on the new google host

on right side you can generate report, send email
you can group the servers als


***********************

Scenario2:

Service level monitoring

Go to slave machine and install nginx server onit, not container, its webserver we are installing

# apt-get install nginx -y

# ps -ef|grep nginx

will give nginx is up and running

this nginx service we want to monitor from nagiosxi

for this

go to configure wizrd--> select service tcp/UDP port

Server address :   give ip address of slave server where nginx is running

server port : http

Custom server port : 

port number : 80
port/application name : nginx webserver
press next
press finsih


it will take time to reflect

Scenario3: bring down nagios webserver and see if really the data and service are being monitored or not

Go to VM2 --slave machine and stop nginx server

# service nginx stop

now got o nagiosxi and click on service nginx webserver


Click on force immediate check

status will be Critical

Click on acknowledge this problem

you name and time will be given

This is port level monitoring or service level monitoring

***********

Service 4: Monitor a URL

got o configure wizard --> select website URL

give url as www.google.com

press next
