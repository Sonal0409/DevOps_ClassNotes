Understanding DemonSet:

A DemonSet can ensure that all Nodes run a copy of a Pod.

As new nodes are added to the cluster, Pods also get created on the new nodes added to Cluster. This is possible with help of DemonSet.


Create a new file as daemonSetdemo.yml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
 name: mydsspec:
 selector:  matchLabels:
    type: webserver 
 template:
  metadata:   
   name: mypod
   labels:    
    type: webserver
  spec:
   containers:
    - image: nginx
      name: c1
      
 save the file
 
 Create the yml file
 
 # kubectl create -f daemonSetdemo.yml
 
 # kubectl get pods -o wide
 
 You will see 3 pods hasve been created on each Node
 
 # kubectl get ds
 
 A daemonset is created with desired pods as 3
 
 # Kubectl describe daemonset myds
 
 
 
 Now add a new node to the cluster
 
 # kubectl get nodes
 
 # kubectl get pods -o wide
 
A pod will be created on the new node also

# kubectl get ds or daemonset
Desired count would have increased to 4 now.
